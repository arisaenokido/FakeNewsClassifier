# FakeNewsClassifier
This is an outdated fake news classifier that utilizes machine learning and classifies headlines that users input as fake news or real news. Here, this model has an accuracy of 0.88 but the data used to conduct the machine learning is very outdated. 

Please install these packages: pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk streamlit matplotlib 
and run: streamlit run fakenews.py
thanks!
